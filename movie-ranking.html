<h3>Maharshi</h3>
<p>What I loved the most about Maharshi is its powerful message about staying connected to your roots and giving back to society. The transformation of Rishi, from a career-focused individual to someone who genuinely cares about farmers and their struggles, is both inspiring and heartwarming.

The movie beautifully shows how success isn't just about personal achievements but also about making a positive impact on others. The scenes where Rishi stands up for the farmers and works to bring about change are truly moving.</p>
<h3>Hanuman</h3>
<p> Hanuman is a beloved animated movie that tells the story of Lord Hanuman, the devoted disciple of Lord Rama and one of the most revered figures in Indian mythology. The movie beautifully narrates his journey from childhood, showcasing his immense strength, intelligence, and unwavering devotion.</p>
<h3>The conjuring</h3>
<p>The Conjuring is a terrifying horror movie based on the real-life cases of paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. It follows a family experiencing haunting events in their new home and the Warrens’ efforts to uncover and fight the dark forces. With its suspenseful story, eerie atmosphere, and jump scares, it’s a must-watch for horror fans!</p>
