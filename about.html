<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Iâ€™m Harshitha, a B.Tech student at Malla reddy engineering college, driven by a strong passion for technology and creativity. Hailing from the vibrant district of Suryapet, I have always been curious about how technology shapes our lives and enjoy exploring its limitless potential.

  I have a solid foundation in programming, with skills in Java, Python, HTML, and CSS, complemented by a basic understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. I am seeking a role as a frontend developer, where I can create dynamic and user-friendly applications that make a difference.
  
  I take pride in being a team player and thrive in environments where I can collaborate with others to grow and contribute meaningfully. Inspired by the wisdom and simplicity of Sudha Murthy, I aspire to develop solutions that are not only innovative but also impactful.
